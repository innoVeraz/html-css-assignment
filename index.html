            Ground Control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your
            helmet on. Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven,
            six). Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three). Check
            ignition and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff). This is
            Ground Control to Major Tom. You've really made the grade. And the
            papers want to know whose shirts you wear. Now it's time to leave
            the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom to Ground Control. I'm
            stepping through the door.

            blue. And there's nothing I can do. Though I'm past one hundred
            thousand miles. I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship.
            knows which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much she knows.
            Ground Control to Major Tom. Your circuit's dead, there's something
            wrong. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can
            you hear me, Major Tom? Can you "Here am I floating 'round my tin
